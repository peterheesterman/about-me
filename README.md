# About me

My name is Peter Heesterman, I am a software developer by profession and an electronics engineer by training. I use to live in Auckland, New Zealand but now I travel a lot. 6 weeks here, 5 weeks there. 

I currently work for [Mish Guru](https://www.mish.guru), a fantastic [New Zealand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) business.
